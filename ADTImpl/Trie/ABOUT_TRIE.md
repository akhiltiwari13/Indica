A Trie (pronounced "try"), also known as a prefix tree or digital tree, is a tree-like data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve a dynamic set of strings (or sequences). It is particularly useful for tasks involving dictionary-like operations, such as searching for words with a common prefix, auto-completion, and pattern matching. The key advantage of a Trie is that it allows for fast lookups and insertions, especially when dealing with large datasets.

Trie data structure:
A Trie is a tree structure where each node represents a single character of a string. The root node represents an empty string, and each level of the Trie corresponds to a character in the string. The nodes along a path from the root to a leaf node form a string represented by that path. Each node typically contains an array or a hashmap (unordered_map in C++) to store its child nodes, with the array or map indexed by the character it represents.

Here's a simple illustration of a Trie containing three strings: "car," "cat," and "cap."

```
        Root
       / | \
      c  a  b
     /   |   \
    a    r    o
   /    /      \
  r    t        t
         \      \
          e      a
                 |
                 p
```

How Trie works in C++:
Let's briefly go over how to implement a basic Trie in C++. We'll use a hashmap (unordered_map) to store child nodes, but you can also use an array if you know the alphabet size and want a more memory-efficient implementation.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
using namespace std;

class TrieNode {
public:
    unordered_map<char, TrieNode*> children;
    bool isEndOfWord;

    TrieNode() {
        isEndOfWord = false;
    }
};

class Trie {
public:
    Trie() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    void insert(const string& word) {
        TrieNode* curr = root;
        for (char c : word) {
            if (curr->children.find(c) == curr->children.end()) {
                curr->children[c] = new TrieNode();
            }
            curr = curr->children[c];
        }
        curr->isEndOfWord = true;
    }

    bool search(const string& word) {
        TrieNode* curr = root;
        for (char c : word) {
            if (curr->children.find(c) == curr->children.end()) {
                return false;
            }
            curr = curr->children[c];
        }
        return curr->isEndOfWord;
    }

    bool startsWith(const string& prefix) {
        TrieNode* curr = root;
        for (char c : prefix) {
            if (curr->children.find(c) == curr->children.end()) {
                return false;
            }
            curr = curr->children[c];
        }
        return true;
    }

private:
    TrieNode* root;
};

int main() {
    Trie trie;
    trie.insert("car");
    trie.insert("cat");
    trie.insert("cap");

    cout << trie.search("car") << endl; // Output: 1 (true)
    cout << trie.search("cab") << endl; // Output: 0 (false)

    cout << trie.startsWith("ca") << endl; // Output: 1 (true)
    cout << trie.startsWith("cr") << endl; // Output: 0 (false)

    return 0;
}
```

Time and Space Complexities:
The time and space complexities of various Trie operations depend on the length of the longest string (or the maximum length of the strings in the Trie) and the number of strings in the Trie.

1. Insertion: O(L), where L is the length of the string to be inserted. We need to traverse the Trie from the root to the leaf, creating new nodes if necessary, which takes O(L) time.

2. Search: O(L), where L is the length of the string to be searched. Similar to insertion, we traverse the Trie to find the string or determine that it does not exist.

3. Prefix Search (startsWith): O(P), where P is the length of the prefix string. Searching for a prefix is also a traversal from the root to a node representing the last character of the prefix.

The space complexity of a Trie is determined by the number of nodes it contains. In the worst case, where there are no shared prefixes among the strings, the number of nodes could be as high as the total number of characters in all the strings. Thus, the space complexity of a Trie is generally considered to be O(N*M), where N is the number of strings and M is the maximum length of the strings.

Keep in mind that space optimization techniques like path compression (also known as Patricia Tries) can be applied to reduce the memory usage in some cases.
